# PrettifyFolder

* This program is a solution to an excercise from a youtube channel CodeWithHarry (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVMnSShP_Iviwkknt83cww) from the playlist : Python tutorials for absolute beginners.
* The function in the program takes a path variable for the path of files to be manipulated. The second parameter is the file which consists of the filenames that should not be changed. The third parameter takes in a file format and numbers the files of its type from 1 to the number of files. Rest of the filenames are just capitalized.
